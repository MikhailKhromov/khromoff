# My site on django (eventually this will be replaced with a domain)
Nothing special.
If you want to run this on your machine, then do this:

`git clone https://github.com/mikhailkhromov/khromoff`\
`cd khromoff`\
`nano khromoff/settings.py`\
insert SECRET_KEY var into there\
`python3 manage.py migrate`\
`python3 manage.py runserver`\
Go to localhost:8000 and here it will be.
